| 1                   | 2     | [0, 1] | 1                   | 3                  | At index 1, the right pointer is at 2. The window expands to [0, 1], including elements at index 0 and 1. Count before update is 1, and after updating, it becomes 3.                      |
| 2                   | 1     | [0, 2] | 3                   | 6                  | At index 2, the right pointer is at 1. The window expands to [0, 2], including elements at index 0, 1, and 2. Count before update is 3, and after updating, it becomes 6.                  |
| 3                   | 2     | [0, 3] | 6                   | 10                 | At index 3, the right pointer is at 2. The window expands to [0, 3], including elements at index 0, 1, 2, and 3. Count before update is 6, and after updating, it becomes 10.              |
| 4                   | 3     | [3, 4] | 10                  | 12                 | At index 4, the right pointer is at 3. The window shifts to [3, 4], including elements at index 3 and 4. Count before update is 10, and after updating, it becomes 12.                     |
| 0                   | 1     | [0, 0] | 0                   | 1                  | At index 0 (second iteration), the right pointer is at 1. The window is [0, 0] again. Count before update is 0.                                                                            |

| 2                   | 1     | [2, 2] | 2                   | 3                  | At index 2 (second iteration), the right pointer is at 1. The window expands to [2, 2], including only the element at index 2. Count before update is 2, and after updating, it becomes 3. |
| 3                   | 2     | [3, 3] | 3                   | 4                  | At index 3 (second iteration), the right pointer is at 2. The window shifts to [3, 3], containing only the element at index 3. Count before update is 3, and after updating, it becomes 4. |
| 4                   | 3     | [4, 4] | 4                   | 5                  | At index 4 (second iteration), the right pointer is at 3. The window shifts to [4, 4], containing only the element at index 4. Count before update is 4, and after updating, it becomes 5. |

`countSubarrays(nums, k)`: This function calculates the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements. For example, if k is 2, it will count subarrays with 1 distinct element, subarrays with 2 distinct elements, and so on.

`countSubarrays(nums, k - 1)`: This function calculates the count of subarrays with at most k - 1 distinct elements. For example, if k is 2, it will count subarrays with 1 distinct element only.

**Subtraction**: By subtracting the count of subarrays with at most k - 1 distinct elements from the count of subarrays with at most k distinct elements, we effectively remove the subarrays with fewer than k distinct elements. This leaves us with only the subarrays that have exactly k distinct elements.

So, the expression `countSubarrays(nums, k) - countSubarrays(nums, k - 1)` gives us the count of subarrays with exactly k distinct elements, which is what we want.
